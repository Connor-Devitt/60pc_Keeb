# 60pc_Keeb
60% size mechanical keyboard design including PCB, frame, firmware. 

## The PCB (built using kiCAD)
* PCB uses a standard 60% keyboard layout
* Footprints designed for Cherry MX and clones.
* Microcontroller is ATmega32u8.
* Interfaces to PC over USB micro.

## The Frame (built using Inventor 2018)
* Made out of sheet aluminum
* Cutouts for cherry style stabilizers
* Approximatly 5 degree slope

## The Firmware

## Directories
* /HW/PCB contains schematics, layouts, gerber, and drill files
* /HW/Mech contains the frame design and keyboard assemblie
* /HW/3D contains renderings of the keyboard
* /HW/BOM contains a full parts list.
* /SW contains all firmware
